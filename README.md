## :pencil: Translating WAI Resources

Thank you for your interest in translating resources from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

Please see key information on translating WAI resources in: [Translating WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/translating/)

## :rocket:	Project dashboard

We use a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/46) to track translations progress.
