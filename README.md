Thank you for your interest in translating resources from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

## :book: Glossaries

See glossaries in the `glossaries/` folder.

### Tips
* Check other translations in your language to see how similar words and concepts have been translated.\
See list of [All WAI/Web Accessibility Translations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/translations/). [Authorized Translations](https://www.w3.org/Translations/authorized.html) have had significant review and input.
* Consider different dialects. Where possible, use words and phrases that will be best understood across different areas.
