## W3C WAI

Guidance on using "W3C" and "the Web Consortium" will be updated later in 2021.

For now:
* When "W3C" is not with "World Wide Web Consortium", treat "W3C" as a stand-alone name, not an acronym. Do not write it out in the translation if it is not written out in the English version.
* Treat "W3C", "W3C WAI", and "WAI" as a proper noun. In most gender-based languages, don't use an article.

Background is in this [French translation thread](https://github.com/w3c/translation-glossaries/issues/24#issuecomment-826778988).

## Acronyms WCAG, ARIA, EOWG, etc.

For W3C Working Group names and Technical Reports, translate the words written out. Leave the acronym in English. For example:

 _in English:_ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

_in German:_ Richtlinien f√ºr barrierefreie Webinhalte (WCAG)

## WCAG 2 and WCAG 3 are different

* WCAG 3 = W3C Accessibility Guidelines
* WCAG 2 = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

## Capitalize W3C terms

[W3C process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/)-related terms should be translated and capitalized.
This includes:
* Groups: Working Group, Interest Group, Business Group, Community Group, Task Force.
* W3C bodies: W3C Members, Team, Advisory Board, Advisory Committee, Technical Architecture Group
* Technical Reports: Working Group Note, Interest Group Note, Working Draft, First Public Working Draft, Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation, Candidate Recommendation.

Note: W3C Members are organizations. Individuals in groups are "participants" in a group (not "members" of a group).

## Capitalization - titles and headings

W3C documents use headline-style capitalization (where every major word is capitalized) for document titles. Some also use headline-style capitalization for headings within the document (including h1, h2, etc.).

Translations should use the proper capitalization for your language.
## You
* Use formal form of "you".
* If you think the informal "you" is better in your language, please open a GitHub issue for gathering input from others.
* Background: [GitHub issue: "you" translate formal](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website/issues/123)
* (Example of "you" in a W3C WAI resource: <q>You may use this video if you include a link to this page.</q> ([in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/#permission)))
